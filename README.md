TITLE

It is a fun friendly game that tests your memory and your skill to apply it when under the pressure. In... you have a timer set to 2 minutes to which within those 2 minutes you will have to go through all 5 levels without missing or changing the order of the patterns presented at the top of your screen. Starting off easy with 3 color patterns to memorize, then 6, and then for the final and biggest challenege... 9!! Have fun, test yourself, and see just how far your can get when you are put to the test!

Next Steps
For future enhancements, I would like to add music in the background to make the game more
enjoyable and soothing

Another enhancement would be to add interactive animation that would randomly appear; 
where a cartoon hand would appear from the side of the screen that would reach for the detonate button. 
To stop it you would need to click on it and it will then reverse back. Otherwise the hand enables 
to detonate and you lose the game
