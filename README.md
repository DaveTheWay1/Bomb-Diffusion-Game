Next Steps
For future enhancements, I would like to add music in the background to make the game more
enjoyable and soothing

Another enhancement would be to add interactive animation that would randomly appear; 
where a cartoon hand would appear from the side of the screen that would reach for the detonate button. 
To stop it you would need to click on it and it will then reverse back. Otherwise the hand enables 
to detonate and you lose the game
