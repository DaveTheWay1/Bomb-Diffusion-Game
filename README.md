But if the player messes up while trying to level up, the loss will display and the characters go for a spin. The Play again button is then also displayed

Next Steps
I would like to add more sounds where the clicking of each color/character makes a sound, a winning sound, and a losing sound

Additionally id like to add the characters be shown above as well rather than just the colors

Another enhancement would be to add interactive animation that would randomly appear; 
where a cartoon hand would appear from the side of the screen that would reach for the detonate button. 
To stop it you would need to click on it and it will then reverse back. Otherwise the hand enables 
to detonate and you lose the game
